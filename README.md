# This is a practice project to a web application for a Hospital

- The purpose of this web application is to store sensative, patient clinical trail information
- Multiple Hospitals would use it
- Very from heacy with data input and output
- Requires alot of asynchronous server calls to navigate.

Somethings this will require,

1. Authenciated user/registration/login system - so multiple hospitals/staff could log in
2. Since this will take alot of data, a redux store is essential. Might also store the data in a created API
3. MySQL integratiom

Step 1 - create the markups of the pages design.
Step 2 - Take those desings to Figma
Step 3 - Take the Figma layout and built the frontend
